# Do not touch Local Legacy Vault (LLV)

When working on **AfterPassing Guide**:

- **Only edit, read, or run commands under:** `C:\dev\AfterPassingGuide`
- **Never edit, read, or run commands under:** `C:\dev\LocalLegacyVault` or any path that refers to "LocalLegacyVault" or "LLV" as the project/codebase
- The user's workspace may be LocalLegacyVault; that does **not** mean we are working on LLV. AfterPassing Guide is a **separate project** in `C:\dev\AfterPassingGuide`.
- Before any edit or read_file: check the path. If it is under `LocalLegacyVault`, do **not** use it. Use the equivalent or intended file under `AfterPassingGuide` only.
- Do not assume LLV and AfterPassing Guide share code or that changes in one should apply to the other unless the user explicitly asks for both.
- **Localhost / dev server:** If the user says "open localhost", "run the app", "start the server", or similar, use **AfterPassing Guide only**: run `npm run dev` from `C:\dev\AfterPassingGuide` and open `http://localhost:5174`. **Never** open or start Local Legacy Vault (port 5180 or `C:\dev\LocalLegacyVault`).

This rule exists because LLV must not be modified when the task is for AfterPassing Guide.
