# Product summary placement

**Product summary (single line):**  
"A local, offline tool for organizing administrative tasks after a loss."

It defines what the product is, not what the user should do.

## Primary placement

- **Global header subtitle** under the product name (main shell sidebar).
- Example: "AfterPassing Guide" with subtitle "A local, offline tool for organizing administrative tasks after a loss."

## Secondary placements

- **About card:** Settings → About — single line only (no stacking with other lines of the same message).
- **Footer:** Lightweight, muted (e.g. version + "Administrative guidance only" — do not repeat the full product summary in the same surface as About).

## Do not place

- Inside task content
- Repeated on every page body
- Inside disclaimers
- Inside emotional or instructional copy

## Rule

- The product summary should appear **once per surface**, not stacked.
- It defines what the product is, not what the user should do.
