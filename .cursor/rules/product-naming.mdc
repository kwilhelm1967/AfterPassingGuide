# Product naming

- **Product name**: Use **AfterPassing Guide** only. Do not use the repository or folder name as the product name in instructions, docs, or replies to the user.
- In instructions (e.g. terminal, setup), refer to the project location as "the project folder", "your project directory", or "the AfterPassing Guide project" — not by the repo/folder name.
