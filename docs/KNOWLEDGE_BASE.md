## Sample Knowledge Base Articles

### How Checklist Statuses Work

Each checklist item can be marked as:

- Leave for now
- Taking care of this
- Handled
- Not needed

Handled and Not needed items count toward progress. Others do not.

### Adding Documents

You can add PDFs, images, or files you want to keep for reference. Files remain on your device unless exported. Labels and notes are optional and can be added later.

### Using Templates

Templates are starting points. They are written to reduce stress during calls or emails, not to provide legal language. Edit them to match your situation.

### Exporting the Estate Binder

The Estate Binder creates a professional PDF that can be shared with attorneys, courts, or family members. You choose what is included before downloading.

### Data Storage and Privacy

All data is stored locally on your device. Nothing is transmitted to the cloud. Backups are optional and controlled by you.

### Resetting Data

Resetting data clears all AfterPassing Guide information from this device. It does not affect any other products or vaults you may use.
